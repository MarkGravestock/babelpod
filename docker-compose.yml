    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      # Whisper model to use: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2, large-v3
      # Larger models are more accurate but slower and require more RAM
      # Recommended: base (fast, decent accuracy) or small (balanced)
      - ASR_MODEL=base

      # ASR engine: openai_whisper or faster_whisper
      # faster_whisper is 4x faster with same accuracy, but requires more setup
      - ASR_ENGINE=faster_whisper

      # CORS Settings - Allow browser access from any origin
      # Change * to your specific domain for production (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
      - WHISPER_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*

      # Optional: Specify model path to persist models between restarts
      # - ASR_MODEL_PATH=/data/models

    volumes:
      # Cache models to avoid re-downloading on container restart
      - whisper-models:/root/.cache/whisper
      # Optional: If using ASR_MODEL_PATH
      # - ./whisper-models:/data/models

# Usage Instructions:
#
# 1. Start the Whisper service:
#    docker-compose up -d
#
# 2. Wait for the model to download (first time only):
#    docker-compose logs -f whisper
#
# 3. Once running, the API will be available at:
#    http://localhost:9000
#
# 4. View the API documentation at:
#    http://localhost:9000/docs
#
# 5. Configure BabelPod:
#    - Open Settings in BabelPod
#    - Select "Self-Hosted Whisper API"
#    - Set URL to: http://localhost:9000
#    - Save and test!
#
# Performance Tips:
# - tiny model: fastest, least accurate (~1GB RAM)
# - base model: good balance (~1GB RAM) ⭐ Recommended
# - small model: better accuracy (~2GB RAM)
# - medium model: very good accuracy (~5GB RAM)
# - large models: best accuracy (~10GB RAM)
#
# GPU Support:
# - Uncomment the "deploy" section above
# - Install nvidia-docker: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
# - Use the GPU image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest-gpu
#
# Stop the service:
#    docker-compose down
#
# Remove cached models:
#    docker-compose down -v
